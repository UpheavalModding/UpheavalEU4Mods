[h1]Age Overhaul[/h1]
Welcome to Age Overhaul! This mod focuses on making [b]Age Abilities[/b] available for all nations (if configured for such) and allowing players (and AI nations!) the ability to carry over previously purchased [b]Age Abilities[/b] from one age to the next.

[h1]Features[/h1]
- Unlocks country-specific [b]Age Abilities[/b] for purchase by all countries
- Ability to carry over Age Abilities from one age to the next using [b]Golden Splendor[/b]
- Full configuration of all features

[h1]"Golden Splendor"[/h1]
[b]Golden Splendor[/b] is the currency that is used to carry over [b]Age Abilities[/b] from one age to the next. It is generated every time you purchase an [b]Age Ability[/b] in a particular age. At the end of the Age, a menu will appear that will allow you to repurchase [b]Age Abilities[/b] that you had previously owned in the last Age. Unlike regular Splendor, [b]Golden Splendor[/b] carries through different Ages, allowing you to stockpile [b]Golden Splendor[/b].

Configuration options for the mod allow you to:
- Change how much [b]Golden Splendor[/b] is generated when you purchase a new [b]Age Ability[/b].
- Change how much [b]Golden Splendor[/b] it costs to purchase a previously owned [b]Age Ability[/b] in future Ages.
- Modify a multiplier that will make older [b]Age Abilities[/b] progressively more expensive as time goes on (e.g. Age of Discovery bonuses can be progressively harder to maintain the longer things last).
- Enable or Disable carrying over Age Abilities

[h1]Future Plans[/h1]
- Balancing
- New Age(s)? Age of Enlightenment and/or Age of Industrialization (balancing concerns, etc. need to be worked through first)
- Rework of the mod to allow easier time supporting other mods that touch Age Abilities (if possible)
- Rework the configuration menus to allow more granular control over Golden Splendor Generation and Cost (similar to the starting Golden Splendor menu)
- Configuration of the max power an Age Ability can be when carried over (i.e. if you want to cap it at 50% strength only)
- Rework of the Age Ability carryover menu to go to the max settings you can purchase at automatically rather than always defaulting to 100%. Or not even pop up if you can't buy anything anyway
- Extra Age Abilties per Age (make it more of a choice which ones you actually purchase rather than being able to pick up all of them)
- Additional ways to generate splendor
