[h1]Age Overhaul[/h1]
Have you felt it weird that the Age Abilities that you purchase in an age magically disappear when a new Age begins, even if you _just_ purchased an ability? Well, fret no more! Now your Age Abilities can carry over between ages, for as long as you want them to!

Age Overhaul focuses on making [b]Age Abilities[/b] available for all nations (if configured for such) and allowing players (and AI nations!) the ability to carry over previously purchased [b]Age Abilities[/b] from one age to the next.

[h1]Features[/h1]
- Unlocks country-specific [b]Age Abilities[/b] for purchase by all countries
- Ability to carry over Age Abilities from one age to the next using [b]Golden Splendor[/b]
- Full configuration of all features
- Safe to drop in to games mid-way

[h1]"Golden Splendor"[/h1]
[b]Golden Splendor[/b] is the currency that is used to carry over [b]Age Abilities[/b] from one age to the next. It is generated every time you purchase an [b]Age Ability[/b] in a particular age. At the end of the Age, a menu will appear that will allow you to repurchase [b]Age Abilities[/b] that you had previously owned in the last Age. Unlike regular Splendor, [b]Golden Splendor[/b] carries through different Ages, allowing you to stockpile [b]Golden Splendor[/b].

Configuration options for the mod allow you to:
- Change how much [b]Golden Splendor[/b] is generated when you purchase a new [b]Age Ability[/b].
- Change how much [b]Golden Splendor[/b] it costs to purchase a previously owned [b]Age Ability[/b] in future Ages.
- Modify a multiplier that will make older [b]Age Abilities[/b] progressively more expensive as time goes on (e.g. Age of Discovery bonuses can be progressively harder to maintain the longer things last).
- Enable or Disable carrying over Age Abilities
- Settings for enabling/disabling decisions for converting Golden Splendor to Splendor and vice-versa
- Settings for changing whether Country-Specific Age Abilities (i.e. The Guns of Urban) can be unlocked by other nations

[h1]Tutorial/Example of Mechanics[/h1]
[i]With Default Settings[/i]
[h3]Age of Discovery[/h3]
-Player purchases the [b]The Guns of Urban[/b] ability, generating 800 [b]Golden Splendor[/b], but is unable to purchase any other abilities this age.
[h3]Age of Reformation[/h3]
- Player has 800 [b]Golden Splendor[/b] upon entering into the Age. When the menu to repurchase abilities pops up, they repurchase the [b]The Guns of Urban[/b] ability, using all their [b]Golden Splendor[/b].
- During the Age, the player purchases the [b]Powerful Tradeships[/b] and [b]Religious Wars[/b] abilities, generating a total of 1600 [b]Golden Splendor[/b].
[h3]Age of Absolutism[/h3]
- Player has 1600 [b]Golden Splendor[/b] upon entering into the Age. Since they had repurchased the [b]The Guns of Urban[/b] in the last Age, it and [b]Powerful Tradeships[/b] and [b]Religious Wars[/b] are all available to purchase. They repurchase [b]The Guns of Urban[/b] and [b]Religious Wars[/b] for the next age, using all their 1600 [b]Golden Splendor[/b].
- During the Age, the player purchases the [b]Administrative Efficiency[/b] and [b]Absolute Government[/b] abilities, generating a total of 1600 [b]Golden Splendor[/b].
[h3]Age of Revolutions[/h3]
- Player has 1600 [b]Golden Splendor[/b] upon entering into the Age. Since they had repurchased the [b]The Guns of Urban[/b] and [b]Religious Wars[/b] in the last Age, they and [b]Administrative Efficiency[/b] and [b]Absolute Government[/b] are all available to purchase, while [b]Powerful Tradeships[/b] is not available to purchase since it was not active in the Age of Absolutism. They repurchase [b]The Guns of Urban[/b] and [b]Religious Wars[/b] for the next age, using all their 1600 [b]Golden Splendor[/b].
- etc.

- Patches so the mod can work with other mods that touch Age Abilities (ex.: [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2172666098]Ages and Splendor Expanded[/url]). Alternatively merging with at least one mod adding those things!
