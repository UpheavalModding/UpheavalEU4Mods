- Dynamic development
- Prosperity should increase chance of events boosting development
- devestation should increase chance of events removing development
--- development should be split between: some should disappear, some should move to other provinces (ones that are still under control or ruled by another nation)
--- once the war is done, provinces should have a bit of a bounce-back feature to regain some development quicker than normal
- Provinces with rivers, harbors, trade hubs, etc. should go quickly (capitols too!)
- Provinces in mountains should grow slower
