[h1]Unequal Nations[/h1]
Inspired by [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1919755765]Unequal Countries[/url], this mod provides a random set of nerfs and buffs to nations throughout the world, providing a more dynamic world with new and unique situations.

[h1]Features[/h1]
- Full configuration of all features
- 7 tiers and 9 categories of buffs and nerfs
- Legendary countries with extra buffs
- Ability for player nation to be impacted by buffs and nerfs
- Ability to reroll buffs and nerfs midgame

[h1]Legendary Country[/h1]
[b]Legendary Countries[/b] are countries with maxed out buffs, and with an extra extremely powerful buff that makes them extremely formidable. Various settings allow there to be more than one legendary country at a time, and to set minimum development sizes for countries that are considered for being legendary allowing for the possibility of powerful "bosses" for players.

[h1]Future Plans[/h1]
- Balancing (let me know what you all think of the current balance!)
- More settings for when to reroll buffs?
- More tiers?
- More categories?
--- Might split/rebalance existing categories to support more
- Compatibility with mods adding new Ages
- Legendary Nerf
- rerolls on monarch deaths
