- More leaders! (there should be a way to get more leader slots...maybe a province building line (i.e. War Academy))
- More unit type groups (start with Europe by having a Britannic, Germanic, French, Iberic, and Byzantine group)
- Artillery from beginning?
- Way to reform your military into another unit type group easily?
- Ships per culture group (i.e. natives should have something, and China/Japan should have Junks (and Korea Turtleships))
- Army Doctrines
